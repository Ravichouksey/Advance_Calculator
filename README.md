# Advance_Calculator
My Advanced Calculator is built using Python and Tkinter with a modern dark GUI and colorful responsive buttons for a fast, attractive look. Users can enter numbers and expressions in the entry box and perform calculations using buttons. It supports basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) as well as advanced functions like square root, power, logarithms, natural log, factorial, and trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), along with constants Ï€ and e. It also includes C (clear) and backspace buttons, with built-in error handling for invalid inputs. My name, Ravi Chouksey, is displayed at the top-right corner for personalization. Overall, My Advanced Calculator combines GUI, scientific functions, fast response, and stylish design in a single complete modern calculator.
